== PROJECT: Contact Tracing

---

== Overview

The contact tracing app is an extension of the Trace Together app recently developed by GovTech.
It aims to simplify the way analysts query over data to understand cluster hotspots and individual behaviour.
This app is built over https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S2/addressbook-level3[AddressBook - Level 3]

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: defined *core backend framework of application*

** *What*: Refractored previous code, adding new concepts such as `Conditions` / `Aggregator` / `InMemoryStorage`
that form the backbone of new features being introduced to meet user requirements.
Refer to https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W15-1/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#class-diagram-illustration[Developer Guide] for more details.

** *Justification*:
*** Present code base does not implement Data Access Objects (DAO) protocols for abstracting data access from the application.
*** Introducing `Conditions` / `Aggregator` classes allows easy extensibility of code base to accommodate new features.
*** Highlights: Team member follows this concept to build his features.
*** Credits: https://stackoverflow.com/[StackOverflow]

* *Major enhancement*: proposed *idea and motivation for Contact Tracing app*





* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
