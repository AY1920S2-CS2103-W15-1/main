== Introduction

Contact Tracing App is for contract tracing during virus transmission, in order to make better
decisions when it comes to virus spreading control. This app collect contact information from mobile
phone users and maintains a record in a database system. A periodic and detailed report will be generlized 
for all users including the hotpot of virus transmission. Every citizen can log into this app with 
personal information such as citizen ID, name, etc.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ContactTracing.jar` link:{releaseUrl}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `from <ts: start> to <ts: end>`: Searches for all interactions from start to end timestamp
* `id is <user: id>`: Searches for all interactions with the user ID
* `pairs <user1: id> and <user2: id>`: Searches for all interactions with the containing user 1 and user 2
* `danger <threshold: counts>`: Searches for user pairs which has occured more than *threshold
* `person`: Shows all registered users in the system
* `person_by <person: id>`: Shows all information wrt to a user
* `person_add /name <person: name> /mobile <person: mobile> /nric <person: nric> /age <person: age>`: Adds a new user to the system
* `person_delete /userid <person: id>`: Deletes an existing user to the system

* *`reports`* : list all recent reports about virus transmission and current situation.
* *`exit`* : Exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

== Querying over collected trace data
=== Searching over timestamp : `From`
Retrieves collected trace data based on by timestamp filter.

Format: `from <ts: start> to <ts: end>`

Example: `from 1500000000 to 1500001000`

*Note: Currently accepted timestamp is in epoch timing. For example on how to use the timing, refer link:{epochTiming}/releases[here]

=== Searching over user ID : `id is`
Retrieves all trace data based on a given user id

Format: `id is <user: id>`

Example: `id is 1`

=== Searching over user ID pairs : `pairs`
Retrieves all trace data that contains interactions between 2 user pairs

Format: `pairs <user1: id> and <user2: id>`

Example: `pairs 1 and 2`

=== Searching for danger signs : `danger`
Identifies user pairs that are most at risk, based on occurrence spanning more than a threshold count.
These individuals are obviously not practicing good social distancing and are a threat to the community.

Format: `danger <threshold: counts>`

Example: `danger 10` will flag out user pairs which are present more than 10 times

== Querying user related information
=== Searching all users: `person`
Shows all users registered in the system

Format: `person`

=== Filtering by user: `person_by`
Applies a filter to perform quick search on a user

Format: `person_by <person: id>`

Example: `person_by 1` will find information on user ID 1

=== Adding a new user: `person_add`
Registers a new user to the system

Format: `person_add /name <person: name> /mobile <person: mobile> /nric <person: nric> /age <person: age>`

Example: `person_add /name John Doe /mobile 92139231 /nric S1323923P /age 50` adds a new user with fields

==== Constraints
* Sequence must abide in sequence /name, /mobile, /nric, /age
* Cannot add same NRIC number

=== Adding a new user: `person_deletes`
Registers a new user to the system

Format: `person_delete /userid <person: id>`

Example: `person_delete /userid 1` deletes any record with user ID 1

== FAQ
